Simple-TCP-like-transport-layer-protocol
========================================

It is a simplified TCP­-like transport layer protocol. The protocol should provide reliable, in order delivery of a stream of bytes. It can recover from in­-network packet loss, packet corruption, packet duplication and packet reordering and should be able cope with dynamic network delays. However, it doesn’t support congestion or flow control.
